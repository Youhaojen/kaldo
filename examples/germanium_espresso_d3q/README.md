# Germanium bulk d3q
Example Germanium bulk (2 atoms in the basis), whose forces are generated by Quantum Espresso and d3q

fc directory: CONTROL, espresso.ifc2 and FORCE_CONSTANTS_3RD file

espresso.ifc and FORCE_CONSTANTS_3RD are generated by Quantum Espresso and d3q by the inputs in : d3q_inputs/ 
The CONTROL file is generated according shengbte format.

Example of d3q thermal conductivity result in d3q_inputs/output.TK-sma
