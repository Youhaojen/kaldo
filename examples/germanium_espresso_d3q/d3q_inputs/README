Create 2nd- and 3rd- Interatomic Force Constants for Ge bulk using Quantum Espresso and d3q.
###
./run 
###

Uncommenting the second part of the "run" file, d3q also computes the thermal conductivity in the SMA approximation (equivalent to RTA in kaldo). Example in output.TK-sma.
After FORCE_CONSTANTS_3RD, the phonon calculation can be rerun with a different supercell.
